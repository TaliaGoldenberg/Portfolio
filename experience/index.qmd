I've had the privilege to work with Odyssey World International on their Community Action Map project. On this mapping initiative, I review listening sessions to extract key insights and aggregated data on healthcare providers of color in Clark County WA to create a Community Action Map, ensuring marginalized communities can access culturally competent care.

My work at the LGBTQ Center in Orange County CA involved analyzing survey statistics to measure program success, designing data-driven presentations, and researching policy topics related to mental health and advocacy.
