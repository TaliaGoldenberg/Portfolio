    "section": "How Does Minecraft Version Affect Success Rate",
    "text": "How Does Minecraft Version Affect Success Rate\nThis experiment investigates whether or not a person’s Minecraft experience level influences their ability to perform and accomplish a task, particularly finding diamond ores. To answer this question, I designed an experiment where 50 Willamette student, ages 18-24, were randomly assigned one of two Minecraft versions and were categorized by self-assessed player levels: Noob, Intermediate, and Expert. Each participant had 30 minutes in a randomly generated world to collect as many diamonds as they could with the game settings standardized across three devices to minimize confounding factors. The response variables of total diamonds collected, number of deaths, experience points, and time until the first diamond was collected and analyzed through statistical functions in R and data visualization. Findings from this experimental analysis indicate a clear correlation between a player’s experience level and their success rate in finding diamonds, with expert players dominating each category and showcasing more advanced skills in gathering diamonds.\nBelow I created two data sets, one with and one without, NA values to visualize Time to First Diamond and Player Experience.\nds_no_NA %&gt;%\nggplot(aes(x=`Time to First Diamond (min)`))+\n  geom_histogram(fill=\"forestgreen\", color=\"black\", binwidth = 1)+\n  labs (title=\"Number of Players by Time to First Diamond (min)\", \n        x=\"Time to First Diamond (min)\",\n        y=\"Number of Players\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 8:30)+\n  theme_bw ()\n\ndsALL %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x=`Player Experience`))+\n  geom_bar(fill=\"forestgreen\", color=\"black\")+\n  labs (title=\"Player Self-Assessed Level\", \n        x=\"Player Experience\",\n        y=\"Number of Players\") +\n  theme_bw ()\n\ndsALL %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x=`Player Experience`, y=`Number of Deaths`))+\n  geom_boxplot(fill=\"forestgreen\", color=\"black\")+\n  facet_grid(.~`Player Experience`)+\n  labs (title=\"Player Experience by XP\", \n        x=\"XP\",\n        y=\"Player Experience\") +\n  theme_bw ()\nThis code shows a Tukey test. This compares each player’s skill level versus the number of deaths to see if there is any noticeable correlation. This shows that some of the values cross over the 0 line meaning that there must not be statistical significance between any of the different possible combinations. It also shows that all of our P-values are far above the 0.05 threshold meaning that we fail to reject the null hypothesis. Meaning there is not enough evidence to suggest a statistical difference.\ntukey2=aov(`Number.of.Deaths`~`Player.Experience`,data=ds)\ntukeyModel2=TukeyHSD(tukey2,conf.level=0.95)\ntukeyModel2\nplot(tukeyModel2)\nThe following code is for a linear regression. Overall this linear regression satisfies all the components of a LINE test as well as has independent observations as discussed earlier. However, there is some cause for concern as some of the data does not look perfect, thus future research should keep this in mind.\nmod5=lm(`Diamonds.Found`~`XP`,data=ds)\nsummary(mod5)\npar(mfrow=c(2,2))\nplot(mod5)"
